# Skltn

**Skeleton** or *skltn* for short is a simple set of files and assets. It’s essentially the bare minimum to get your web project on it’s feet. To use this as a workflow simply clone this repo grab a copy of [Codekit](http://incident57.com/codekit/). Then add your folder as a codekit project. Then once you start your project all your files should compile into the *build* folder.
